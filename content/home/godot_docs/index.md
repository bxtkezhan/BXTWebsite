Welcome to the official documentation of Godot Engine, the free and open source community-driven 2D and 3D game engine! If you are new to this documentation, we recommend that you read the introduction page to get an overview of what this documentation has to offer.

The table of contents below and in the sidebar should let you easily access the documentation for your topic of interest. You can also use the search function in the top left corner.

It means that the documentation team can always use your feedback and help to improve the tutorials and class reference. If you do not manage to understand something, or cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, help us make the documentation better by letting us know!
